# moringa_phase1_project

## Project motto: "simple is better than complex!"

## Overview
This repo is an end of phase project i.e. phase 1. The business problem was aiding a company Microsoft to decide on the films to create since they had created a studio. The task was simple: explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. IMDB and BOM.MOVIE_GROSS were the datasets used. CRISP-DM was the methodology implemented, and three recommendations on the type of films to create, the studios to partner with and the length of films to create were made.

## Business Understanding
* Microsoft has setup a movie studio but dont know anything about creating movies. The problem is key to this project as the project seeks to aid them on how to go about some of the details.
* The data analysis questions were picked after examining both datasets i.e data preparation. They are chosen because they give distinct answers on what and who to engage with.

## Data Understanding and EDA
* The datasets used in this analysis were obtained from IMDB sites and BOM MOVIES. They are key since they help to debunk which genres are the best based on their average rating, the average runtime of a film to create and the studios to partner with.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis done, the following recommendations were made:
* That Microsoft should produce films that are comedy, documentaries or fictional. The analysis ranked these genres as the most lucrative.
* That Microsoft should partner with famous studios from the ones identified. The analysis gave the top 5 studios in terms of their domestic and foreign gross revenue.
* That Microsoft should limit their average film runtime to between 120 and 170 minutes. Based on the analysis, films that had this runtime acquired more votes.
